<p class="paragraph">Opera Mini is a mobile web browser developed
    by Opera Software AS. It was primarily designed for the Java ME
    platform, as a low-end sibling for Opera Mobile, but it is now
    developed exclusively for Android and iOS. It was previously
    developed for Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Phone 8.1, BlackBerry,
    Symbian, and Bada.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Opera Mobile supports secured web pages, whereas
    Opera Mini isn't the best browser for secure sites. The high memory
    version of Opera Mini will support encrypted pages, but because all
    websites are loaded through the Opera servers, the page will be decrypted
    and then re-encrypted.</p>
