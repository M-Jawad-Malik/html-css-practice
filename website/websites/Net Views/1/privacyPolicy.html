    Net Views respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. We provide this Privacy Statement to let you know about Net Views Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Net Views”) privacy practices relating to this web site, of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online, and how that information is used and disclosed by Net Views in accordance with applicable privacy legislation.

  <p>
    We have structured our web site so that you can visit us online without identifying yourself or revealing any Personal Information unless you choose to. By using our site, you consent to the collection, use, transfer, and storage of your Personal Information by Net Views. “Personal information” is defined as information that (1) is recorded in any form; (2) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (3) can be linked to that individual.

  <p>
    Our privacy policy is modeled on accepted Canadian, American and European Standards for the Protection of Personal Information. It enables compliance with federal and provincial/state legislation such as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP), and typical privacy statutes of the United States.

  <h3>What We Use Your Information For</h3>
  <p>
    When we ask you for Personal Information, we will let you know why we need it and what we are going to do with it. Of course, subject to legal and contractual requirements, you can always refuse to submit your information or withdraw your consent to any further collection, use, or disclosure of your information at any time by giving us reasonable notice. Most importantly, Net Views will not use your Personal Information for any purpose other than the one stated when you provided it.
  </p>
  
  <p>If you request information on products or services, enter a contest or respond to a promotional offer, questionnaire or survey, you may be asked for Personal Information. We value your privacy and will keep your information secure, but please be aware that Net Views reserves the right to disclose information where required by law; at all times to comply with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order; to protect Net Views’s rights and property; or during emergencies when safety is at risk.</p>
